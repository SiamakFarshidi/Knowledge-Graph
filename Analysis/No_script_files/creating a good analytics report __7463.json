The two proposed changes are as follows Move the ball forward 10 yards after a Fair Catch. Once you pass that first lookover you can expect someone will dig into your code. That s not so much the case here with the sponsors giving us an extensive list and subtopics to explore.

Defenseless players as described by NFL rules include players receiving a blindside block from a blocker whose path is toward or parallel his own end line.

Kaggle makes it easy with the hide input option. Another thing you might consider is to hide your code. So it s best to start with your conclusion get the reader s interest and give them a frame of reference from which to hang supporting information.
