In premature babies Respiratory distress in premature babies often requires placement of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. Some medical conditions especially neurological conditions can result in full or partial paralysis of the diaphragm and may require respiratory support. The problem of central line associated bloodstream infections CLABSI has gained increasing attention in recent years. The obturator is used to insert a tracheostomy tube. There are many reasons why an endotracheal tube may be placed including surgery with a general anesthetic trauma or serious illness. In this notebook is all the knowledge that I gathered. Infection Pneumothorax collapse of a lung If the endotracheal tube is advanced too far such that it only enters one bronchus and thus ventilates only one lung inadequate ventilation may occur or collapse of one lung. Delivery of certain medications or fluids medications such as vasopressors e. The process of inserting the tube is called endotracheal intubation. Do checkout the following notebook if you want to get a pictorial explanation of the problemhttps www. jpg Medical UsesThe following are the major indications for the use of central venous catheters Difficult peripheral venous access central venous catheters may be placed when it is difficult to gain or maintain venous access peripherally e. Of course this is not always possible particularly in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Rarely they are introduced by contaminated infusions. As always please upvote if you like the content OverviewIn very simple words our task here is to determine whether the positioned lines and tubes in patients are optimally placed or not. Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies for more reliable vascular access. The tube maintains the airway so that air can pass into and out of the lungs. If this goes unnoticed the lack of oxygen to the body could result in brain damage cardiac arrest or death. However it has a reported incidence of 0. An endotracheal tube is placed when a patient is unable to breathe on their own when it is necessary to sedate and rest someone who is very ill or to protect the airway. These include General surgery With general anesthesia the muscles of the body including the diaphragm are paralyzed and placing an endotracheal tube allows the ventilator to do the work of breathing. These are manufactured by different companies. 5 11 when an anatomical approach is used. Complications and RisksThere are both short term and long term risks and complications associated with endotracheal tube placement. I have a habit of going throughly through the problem domain before attempting the problem at hand. In addition sending blood samples for acidity oxygen and carbon dioxide content pH pO2 pCO2 respectively can show the characteristics of an artery higher pH pO2 lower pCO2 or vein lower pH pO2 higher pCO2. pulmonary artery catheterization require central venous access. In the case of catheterization of the internal jugular vein the risk of pneumothorax is minimized by the use of ultrasound guidance. Instead bedside ultrasound is a superior method of detection in those too ill to obtain upright imaging. If a pneumothorax is suspected an upright chest x ray should be obtained. Complications if not properly insertedCentral line insertion may cause several complications. Later Complications that may occur while the tracheostomy tube is in place include Accidental removal of the tracheostomy tube accidental decannulation Infection in the trachea and around the tracheostomy tube Windpipe itself may become damaged for a number of reasons including pressure from the tube bacteria that cause infections and form scar tissue or friction from a tube that moves too much Central Venous Catheter CVC A central venous catheter CVC also known as a central line central venous line or central venous access catheter is a catheter placed into a large vein. During subclavian vein central line placement the catheter can be accidentally pushed into the internal jugular vein on the same side instead of the superior vena cava. Specialized treatment interventions such as hemodialysis plasmapheresis transvenous cardiac pacing and invasive hemodynamic monitoring e. obesity scarred veins from prior cannulations agitated patient. However a specific type of tracheostomy tube will be the same no matter which company manufactures them. It is a form of venous access. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence UK and other medical organizations recommend the routine use of ultrasonography to minimize complications. To visualize the airway If an abnormality of the larynx trachea or bronchi is suspected such as a tumor or a congenital malformation birth defect an endotracheal tube may be placed to allow careful visualization of the airways. This occurs at a rate of approximately 1 when ultrasound guidance is used. It has a lock to keep it from being coughed out and it is removed for cleaning. They cause a great deal of morbidity harm and deaths and increase health care costs. au wp content uploads images fact sheets tracheostomy tubes. Foreign body removal If the trachea is obstructed by a foreign body that is aspirated breathed in an endotracheal tube may be placed to help with the removal of the foreign object. This can result in serious infections that can be fatal in up to 25 of cases. https images na. Additionally bacteria present in the blood may attach to the surface of the catheter transforming it into a focus of infection. uk wp content uploads 2013 08 trach1. They might also gain access to the lumen of the catheter through break points such as hubs. Fortunately the incidence of these events is exceedingly rare especially when lines are placed with ultrasound guidance. Learn about the procedure potential risks and complications and what you might expect. Catheter related bloodstream infections All catheters can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. When a higher concentration of oxygen is needed Endotracheal tube placement and mechanical ventilation allows for the delivery of higher concentrations of oxygen than found in room air. png Complications and Risks of TracheostomyAs with any surgery there are some risks associated with tracheotomies. com prvnkmr radiographic assessment of tubes and lines Central Venous Catheters E2 80 93 Normal Position. Early Complications that may arise during the tracheostomy procedure or soon thereafter include Bleeding Air trapped around the lungs pneumothorax Air trapped in the deeper layers of the chest pneumomediastinum Air trapped underneath the skin around the tracheostomy subcutaneous emphysema Damage to the swallowing tube esophagus Injury to the nerve that moves the vocal cords recurrent laryngeal nerve Tracheostomy tube can be blocked by blood clots mucus or pressure of the airway walls. The benefit expected from their use should outweigh the risk of those complications. To support breathing If someone is having difficulty breathing due to pneumonia a pneumothorax collapse of a lung respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure heart failure or unconsciousness due to an overdose stroke or brain injury an endotracheal tube may be placed to support breathing. Blockages can be prevented by suctioning humidifying the air and selecting the appropriate tracheostomy tube. Dental injuries particularly to the upper incisors occur in around one in 3000 intubations. jpg Uses of Endotracheal TubeThere are a number of indications for placement of an endotracheal tube that can be broken down into a few broad categories. Misplacement CVC misplacement is more common when the anatomy of the person is different or difficult due to injury or past surgery. Wrap UpNow that we have much closer understanding of what are all the equipments what they do and why is is important to properly insert them we go ahead with developing the solutions required to do so. The inner cannula fits inside the outer cannula. Radiographs obtained in the supine position fail to detect 25 50 of pneumothoraces. Additionally catheters with multiple lumens can facilitate the delivery of several parenteral medications simultaneously. Vascular perforation Perforation of vasculature by a catheter is a feared and potentially life threatening complication of central lines. A commonly used tracheostomy tube consists of three parts outer cannula with flange neck plate inner cannula and an obturator. The catheters used are commonly 15 30 cm in length made of silicone or polyurethane and have single or multiple lumens for infusion. com DWqTC7UN6TI W68_j2cL3fI AAAAAAAAB_o 5xIvWDAfQ10sHRSfYYCIb8e16m7SF ZEQCLcBGAs w1200 h630 p k no nu Central 2Bvenous 2Bcatheter. For experienced clinicians the incidence of pneumothorax is about 1. However serious infections are rare. When sedation is required If strong sedatives are needed such as when a person is very ill an endotracheal tube may be placed to assist with breathing until the sedatives can be discontinued. com images I 311qXuPEwCL. Temporary hoarseness when the tube is removed Injury to the mouth teeth or dental structures tongue thyroid gland voice box larynx vocal cords windpipe trachea or esophagus. Long term complications that may persist or arise later on may include Tracheal stenosis or narrowing of the trachea Most common in people who require prolonged intubation and once occurring in around 1 of people who were intubated Tracheomalacia Spinal cord injuries Tracheoesophageal fistula an abnormal passageway between the trachea and esophagus Vocal cord paralysis A rare complication that can cause permanent hoarsenes What is Tracheostomy TubesA tracheostomy trach tube is a curved tube that is inserted into a tracheostomy stoma the hole made in the neck and windpipe Trachea. However the method by which most organisms gain access is by migrating along the portion of the catheter tracking through subcutaneous tissue until they reach the portion of the catheter in the vein. The outer cannula is the outer tube that holds the tracheostomy open. chemotherapeutic agents or hypertonic solutions are damaging to peripheral veins and often require placement of a central line. The tip of the catheter can also be misdirected into the contralateral opposite side subclavian vein in the neck rather than into the superior vena cava. A neck plate extends from the sides of the outer tube and has holes to attach cloth ties or velcro strap around the neck. That is because hospital patients can have serious complications even death if they are positioned incorrectly. There are different types of tracheostomy tubes that vary in certain features for different purposes. If the carotid is accidentally cannulated and a catheter is inserted into the artery the catheter should be left in place and a vascular surgeon should be notified because removing it can be fatal. In this case a person may be weaned from the ventilator at some time during recovery. Microbes can gain access to the bloodstream via a central catheter a number of ways. 1 The diaphragm may also become paralyzed due to damage or pressure on the phrenic nerve related to trauma or a tumor in the chest. If the stomach contents are accidentally breathed in a person may develop aspiration pneumonia a very serious and potentially life threatening disease. jpg https study. After surgery After surgery on the chest such as lung cancer surgery or heart surgery an endotracheal tube connected to a ventilator may be left in place to help with breathing after surgery. To protect the airway against aspiration If someone has a massive gastrointestinal bleed bleeding in the esophagus stomach or upper intestine or suffers a stroke an endotracheal tube may be placed to help prevent the stomach contents from entering the airways. A chest x ray is performed after insertion to rule out this possibility. CVCs can be mistakenly placed in an artery during insertion for example the carotid artery or vertebral artery when placed in the neck or common femoral artery when placed in the groin. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck internal jugular vein chest subclavian vein or axillary vein groin femoral vein or through veins in the arms also known as a PICC line or peripherally inserted central catheters. Aspiration of contents of the mouth or stomach during placement which can in turn result in aspiration pneumonia Persistent need for ventilatory support see below Atelectasis Inadequate ventilation a respiratory rate that is too low can result in collapse of the smallest of airways the alveoli resulting in atelectasis partial or complete collapse of a lung. Devices their Uses and Complications What is Endotracheal Tube and Its purpose An endotracheal tube is a flexible plastic tube that is placed through the mouth into the trachea windpipe to help a patient breathe. Prolonged intravenous therapies parenteral medications that must be delivered for extended periods of time more than a few days such as long term parenteral nutrition or intravenous antibiotics are administered through a central line. Pneumothorax The incidence of pneumothorax is highest with subclavian vein catheterization due to its anatomic proximity to the apex of the lung. An upright chest x ray is preferred because free air will migrate to the apex of the lung where it is easily visualized. It fits inside the tube to provide a smooth surface that guides the tracheostomy tube when it is being inserted. The endotracheal tube is then connected to a ventilator which delivers oxygen to the lungs. Examples include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Guillain Barre syndrome and botulism. Accidental cannulation of the carotid artery is a potential complication of placing a central line in the internal jugular vein. Short term complications may include Bleeding Esophageal placement of the tube One of the most serious complications is improper placement of the endotracheal tube into the esophagus. This error can be quickly identified by special tubing that can show the pressure of the catheter arteries have a higher pressure than veins.
